  # The kubernetes check retrieves metrics from cadvisor running under kubelet on each node.
  # It also queries kubelet for its health and the list of local-running pods.
  #
  # By default we assume we're running under docker and
  # that the kubelet read-only port with no auth is enabled.
  #
  # In this case we will use the address of the default router to
  # reach the kubelet and cadvisor APIs unless the environment variable
  # KUBERNETES_KUBELET_HOST is found (if your node names can be resolved by pods, we recommend you set this variable to spec.nodeName through the downward API).
  #
  # If the read-only endpoint is disabled, the check will query kubelet over HTTPS
  #
  # To override this behavior, e.g. in the case of a standalone cadvisor instance, use the following:
  #
  # host: localhost
  # port: 4194
  # method: http

  # cAdvisor port
 - port: 4194

  # cAdvisor host
  # host: localhost

  # collect_events controls whether the agent should fetch events from the kubernetes API and
  # ingest them in Datadog. To avoid duplicates, only one agent at a time across the entire
  # cluster should have this feature enabled. To enable the feature, set the parameter to `true`.
